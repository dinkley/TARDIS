This is code for a Unity game I worked on quite a while ago.
It's a game I was making to practice my programming skills with C# and Unity.

I've included an old .mp4 file I recorded showcasing the gameplay created from the code.

It's fairly outdated, since it's missing a couple of cool gameplay features.

There's also a song playing in the background because I forgot to pause it, sorry about that.

I've also inluded a screenshot of the game actually running on an Xbox One under Dev Mode.
